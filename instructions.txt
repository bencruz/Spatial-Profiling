'SPATIAL PROFILING'

Press Run to start the scenario and use
the left and right "arrow" keys to control the
character. Nudge up and down with the up and
down "arrow" keys. Avoid hitting all of the
Facebook post boxes. If you hit one,
your player vanishes and the game ends.
It is nearly impossible to beat this scenario.
